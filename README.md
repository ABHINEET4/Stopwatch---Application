The body has a sky blue background color and the content is center-aligned.
The stopwatch container has a burlywood background color, 5px border radius, and a box shadow effect.
The timer has a font size of 36px, bold font weight, and white color. It is displayed at the center of the stopwatch container.

The JavaScript code in script.js handles the functionality of the stopwatch. It includes the following functions:

startTimer(): Starts the timer by incrementing the seconds and updating the timer display every second.
stopTimer(): Stops the timer by clearing the interval.
resetTimer(): Resets the timer by stopping it and setting the minutes and seconds back to 0.
formatTime(minutes, seconds): Formats the time as "MM:SS" and returns the formatted string.
padZero(value): Pads a single-digit value with a leading zero if necessary.
